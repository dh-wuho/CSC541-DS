# CSC541 Advanced Data Structure

These are homework projects of CSC541 Advanced Data Structure. Teamwork with Cheng.

## Project 1

Build a balanced tree. We use Red-Black Tree to implement this data structure.

## Project 2

We are asked to implement a measure so it can return the measure of several intervals in O(1) time. 

We use recursion to build the data structre. It's hard to think and debug, so maybe iteration is a better way.

## Project 3

Implement a bloom filter with murmur hash. The error rate of the bloom filter is less than 2.599%.
