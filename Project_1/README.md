Group Members:
Hao Wu, UnityID: hwu23.
Cheng Yuan, UnityID: cyuan7.

We both get involved in designing the Red-Black Tree data structure and key mechanism. 

Hao built the outline and developed 3 functions: 
- text_t* create_text()
- void append_line(text_t* txt, char* new_line)
- void insert_line(text_t* txt, int index, char* new_line)

Cheng developed 4 functions:
- int length_text(text_t* txt) 
- char* get_line(text_t* txt, int index) 
- char* set_line(text_t* txt, int index, char* new_line)
- char* delete_line(text_t* txt, int index)

All functions are completed and all testcases are passed in EOS server of NCSU.
